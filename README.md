# **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) - Deep Learning Final Project**

## **Project Overview**
This final project for Deep Learning, titled *A comprehensive study of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks*, has been developed by **Arol García Rodríguez**, **Javier González Otero**, and **Iria Quintero García**.  

The focus of the project is to analyze the **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)**, a neural network architecture that leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which states that any multivariate continuous function can be expressed as a composition of univariate functions and addition. This project builds on the foundational work of [Kind Xiaoming](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan), who provided an initial framework for implementing KANs.

All Python Notebooks attached can be executed from **Google Colab**, and the required `.csv` files for the experiments are included.

## **Objectives**
The main objectives of this project are:
- Analyze the **Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem** and its application to neural networks.
- Implement KAN using Python and tools from the `pykan` library.
- Evaluate the performance of KAN on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Compare its efficiency and accuracy with traditional neural network architectures.
